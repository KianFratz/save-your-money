# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies (Node.js 22.13 or newer)

   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

## Quality checks

Run these commands from the project root. They run locally without a phone or network service and exit with a nonzero status when a check fails.

```bash
npm run typecheck      # strict TypeScript check
npm run lint           # ESLint, with warnings treated as failures
npm run format:check   # Prettier check
npm test               # Jest and React Native Testing Library
```

Use `npm run format` to apply Prettier formatting. To run one test file during development, use `npm test -- --runTestsByPath __tests__/home-route.test.tsx`.

The routed test uses `expo-router/testing-library` with React Native Testing Library 13.3.3. Version 14.0.1 passed its package peer checks, but Expo Router 57's exported `screen` stayed uninitialized after `renderRouter`, so route queries and the `toHavePathname` matcher failed. Version 13.3.3 works with this SDK 57 scaffold and is pinned in the lockfile.

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **src/app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
